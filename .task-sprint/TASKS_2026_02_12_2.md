- [x] **1. Make sidebar responsive with mobile hamburger menu** — The sidebar (`components/layout/sidebar.tsx`) is `fixed w-[60px]` with no mobile behavior. On screens < 768px, hide the sidebar entirely and add a hamburger menu button to the header that opens an overlay/drawer nav. On desktop, keep the current hover-expand behavior. Remove the hardcoded `ml-[60px]` from all authenticated pages and instead use a responsive margin (`md:ml-[60px]`) so mobile gets full-width content.

- [x] **2. Make header navigation mobile-friendly** — The header (`components/layout/header.tsx`) shows all nav items inline with `gap-8`. On mobile, hide the desktop nav items (`hidden md:flex`) and show a hamburger/menu icon that triggers the mobile sidebar drawer from task 1. Ensure the user dropdown doesn't extend off-screen on small viewports (currently `w-48` positioned absolutely).

- [x] **3. Remove max-width caps on all authenticated pages for wide screens** — Every authenticated page uses `max-w-[1120px]` or `max-w-[1200px]` which wastes space on wide monitors (1440px+, ultrawide). Either remove the max-width entirely or bump it to `max-w-[1600px] 2xl:max-w-[1800px]` so content fills more of the viewport. Affected files: `dashboard/page.tsx`, `upload/page.tsx`, `jobs/page.tsx`, `jobs/new/page.tsx`, `jobs/[id]/page.tsx`, `clips/page.tsx`, `settings/page.tsx`.

- [x] **4. Add responsive padding to all page containers** — All pages use fixed padding like `px-6`, `px-8`, or `px-10` regardless of screen size. Change to responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` across all page wrappers so mobile screens have tighter padding and desktop screens breathe.

- [x] **5. Fix the upload page video list grid for mobile** — The video list in `upload/page.tsx` uses a hardcoded `grid-cols-[80px_1fr_140px_80px_60px]` which totals ~400px minimum and overflows on phones. On mobile, switch to a stacked card layout (thumbnail on top, metadata below). Use `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[80px_1fr_140px_80px_60px]` or a completely different mobile row component.

- [x] **6. Fix the job list grid for mobile** — `components/jobs/job-list.tsx` uses inline style `gridTemplateColumns: '1fr 320px 80px 100px'` (~500px+ minimum). This will overflow on any phone. On mobile, switch to stacked card layout where job name, status, and actions stack vertically. Apply the grid only at `md:` breakpoint and above.

- [x] **7. Make the create-job form grid responsive** — `components/jobs/create-job-form.tsx` line 241 uses `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4` with no breakpoint. Change to `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4` so form fields stack on mobile.

- [x] **8. Make all fixed-width search inputs responsive** — Multiple components use `w-[200px]` for search inputs: clip gallery, job list, upload page. Change all to `w-full sm:w-[200px]` so they fill available width on mobile and stay compact on desktop.

- [x] **9. Add responsive typography across all pages** — Large headings (`text-4xl`, `text-5xl`, `text-[1.5rem]`) don't scale down for mobile. Apply responsive sizing: hero title `text-3xl sm:text-5xl`, page titles `text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-4xl`, section headings `text-lg sm:text-xl`. Sweep every page's h1/h2/title elements.

- [x] **10. Fix the landing page for mobile** — Home page (`app/page.tsx`): hero `text-5xl` needs `text-3xl sm:text-5xl`, `max-w-lg` on hero section should have mobile padding, features grid needs mobile-friendly spacing, and footer spacing should adapt (`pb-8 md:pb-12`).

- [x] **11. Fix login/signup card padding for mobile** — Both auth pages use `p-10` on the card container which is excessive on small screens. Change to `p-6 sm:p-8 md:p-10`. Also ensure the `max-w-[400px]` card has enough horizontal padding on tiny screens (add `mx-4` or `px-4` to parent).

- [x] **12. Make the settings page fully responsive** — Settings page has the most responsive issues: fixed nav sidebar (`md:fixed md:w-[192px]`), `md:pl-[208px]` content offset, number steppers with `w-[36px]` buttons too small for touch, toggle switches `w-[40px] h-[22px]` below minimum touch target (44px), and output resolution dropdown `w-[200px]`. Make the settings nav horizontal/collapsible on mobile, increase touch targets to 44px minimum, and make dropdowns full-width on mobile.

- [x] **13. Fix the AppShell commentary ticker positioning** — `app/layout.tsx` has a commentary ticker with `left-[60px]` hardcoded for the sidebar width. Make this responsive: `left-0 md:left-[60px]` so it fills the full width on mobile when sidebar is hidden.

- [x] **14. Make clip gallery filter bar mobile-friendly** — `components/clips/clip-gallery.tsx` filter tabs show all options inline. On mobile, the tabs may wrap awkwardly. Either use horizontal scroll with `overflow-x-auto` for the filter tabs or collapse into a dropdown select on mobile. The search input `w-[200px]` is handled in task 8.

- [x] **15. Add wide-screen grid improvements for dashboard components** — While `stats-cards.tsx` and `video-list.tsx` have good responsive grids, they could use wider breakpoints: stats cards `2xl:grid-cols-5` or `2xl:grid-cols-6` on ultrawide, video list `xl:grid-cols-5 2xl:grid-cols-6` to take advantage of extra space. Clip gallery's `minmax(280px, 1fr)` auto-fill already scales well.

- [x] **16. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support** — `globals.css` has multiple animations (scan lines, slide-in, pulse-glow) with no reduced-motion fallback. Wrap animations in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` to respect accessibility settings, especially important on mobile where animations can cause motion sickness.

- [x] **17. Make the hashnet size capped on narrower screens** right now the hash is too long for mobile screens, i want the attennae to be seen regardless of screen size

- [x] the hashnet antenna for should be the same color as the hashnet for some theemes i cannot see them.
- [x] redesign the settings nav for mobile, the design does not work for mobile conceptually. think hard on this.
- [x] the redesign was generally good, but the single tab / selector for profile preferences etc shuold be sticky, and as we scroll it should seamlessly shrink a bit on the leftso that it can slot right beside the 3 flat lines for the sidebar and then stay there as wel scroll. think hard on this.
