- [x] When doing a search lets say we filtered out the first three rows. they fade out which is clean, but then there is no transition for the next threee rows to move up to fill up the available space, it just teleports. fix that
- [x] When switching from all to other categories in jobs the list renders at the bottmo for a split second and then teleports tot he top. fix this
- [x] When switching froma ll to other cateogries in clips theres a weird flash (double fade out) and a double fade in. potentially a race condition or some error with animations? fix that
- [x] When clicking into a job from the homepage i would want the back button to return em back to whatever page i came from instead of being back to jobs and always going to the job apge. also improve the look of the back button and siwtch th text from "back to jobs" to "back"
- [x] theres no animation for the vertical bar when switching from one page to another on the left. add one.
- [x] Move the sports bar horizontal component to somewhere near the bottom (maybe a sticky positioned thing) it doesn't amke sense to randomly have it in the middle. or possibly the top of every page. you decide based onw aht you think looks better
- [x] when reloading the site always first renders as default theme and then sets the theme to the one the user wanted in settings. this is ugly and we can see hte original theme for a split second. resolve this.
- [x] there is still a double flash when switching, however it does look a bit better
- [x] settings navigation rows should be sticky / fixed (wahtever is better here) so it doesn't get scrolled off
- [x] the custom color overrides should save as a custom config. when reloading the page, we should be able to further edit from the custom color config as well as reset. right now it just says "overrides (1 color)" and doesn't let me further edit from that custom config, and if i click on the customize from <theme> text it just resets my config
