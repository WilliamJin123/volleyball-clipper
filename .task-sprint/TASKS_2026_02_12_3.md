- [x] make the settings manage your account and preferences a tab ont he top that is sticky, but only for pc / wide displays (mobile remains unchanged)
- [x] when clicking on a particular row in settings, set the highlight to that row even if it is already inv iew and we aren't scrolling to it directly. in fact, make the scroll awareness for the highlights based on whats in the center of the screen, not the top
- [x] When scrolling the settings page it never naturally highlgihts appearance, it skips over it and goes from profile --> preferences. resolve.
- [x] the scroll and click relationship is a bit buggy, seomtimes the highlight jumps around in the settings page.
- [x] scrolling to the very top doesn't snap us back to profile. fix.
- [x] make the commentary bar base scroll speed a lot faster and make the hover not stop it completely, but slow down the scroll.
- [x] horizontal mobile view of clips page causes the ALl Kills BLocks etc. nav to overflow. fix by making the search clips and sort newest reside on a newline if the all, kills, blocks, serves, digs, does not fit and starts to overflow. this was sepcific to the iphone se dimensions. other ones should remain unchanged those are fine
- [x] Confirm delete should be an actual popup not just a thing that appears below the video rows. also, remove the timeout feature. also, clips should be deletable, i don't think jobs should. jobs act as history.
- [x] ensure jobs can be cancelled cleanly (with supabase db cleaning). if not, add it
- [x] confirm delete popup should be centered on the screen, top left redc confirm text should be removed as it is redundant with confirm delete
- [x] center popup refereed to by last task vertically as well, make sure it is. also amke the three dots that open delete clip vertical instead of horizontal (only for clips, not for videos)
- [x] the popup still appears in the bottom half of my screen vertically. fix.
- [x] remove main max witdth 1000 px limit. i have an ultra wide monitor
- [x] save preferences and save changes should be one button int he left (part of the nav), and auto save / save status shuold also be shwon right under said button.
- [x] save changes buttont ext is slightly off center, also make it horizontally smaller, also ensure autosave is still a thing and shows int he same place that changes saved shows.
